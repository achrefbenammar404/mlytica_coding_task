## Overview

Mlytica AI Assistant is an advanced document-based question-answering application. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the FastAPI framework to provide precise and contextually appropriate answers to user queries based on uploaded documents.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interaction through a clean and straightforward interface built using streamlit.
- **Document Upload**: Easily upload documents for information retrieval.
- **Question-Answering**: Ask questions related to the document's content and receive precise answers.
- **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**: Uses RAG to retrieve relevant context from documents.

## Technical Description

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG retrieves relevant context from the uploaded document to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for the user.

### FastAPI Framework
The backend of the app is built with FastAPI, ensuring fast performance and easy scalability.

### Additional Endpoints
Besides the main functionality, additional endpoints are integrated for uploading files and managing follow-up questions.

## Suggested Future Features

### Enhancements and New Capabilities
1. **Integration with LLM Function Calls**: Future versions could incorporate function calls within large language models to perform complex tasks directly from the user's commands, extending the appâ€™s utility. This can be easily implemented using libraries like Langchain or LlamaIndex.

2. **Multi-Agent System**: Implementing a multi-agent system using CrewAI or LangGraph could address complex, multi-hop questions and facilitate step-by-step planning and reflective processes. This approach improves the quality of results by utilizing iterative workflows and processes (basically LLMs checking each other's answers).

These features could differentiate Mlytica's AI Assistant from other "AI applications" that merely call the OpenAI API.
